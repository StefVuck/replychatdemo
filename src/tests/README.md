# Testing Framework Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing framework designed to verify functionality across all components. The framework will include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

## Structure

- **Integration Tests**: Ensure components work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Validate the entire application flow.

## Tools
- Jest for unit testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run tests: `npm test`

## Reporting
- Coverage reports will be generated for each test run.
